### Requirements

`Dart >=2.18.6` and `Flutter >=1.17.0`

## Getting Started

With Sitesurface Flutter OpenAI Package you can interact with OpenAI API through `OpenAIClient` object.
In order to use the API, you need to have an API key. You can get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and once you have it, you can use it in the client passing the key itself in the `OpenAIConfig` constructor.

```dart
final _openAiClient = OpenAIClient(OpenAIConfig(
      apiKey: "---your API key here---",
      organizationId: "---your Organization Id here---"));
```

- **Completions**. Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions, and can also return the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position. You can learn more [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)
  You can access completion methods like below

```dart
  _openAiClient.completions.createCompletion(request);
```

## ChatBot

You can use the `ChatGPTBuilder` to build your chatbot. Here `messages` contains the messages from user and ChatGPT.You can use `onSend` to send the text message.

```dart
return ChatGPTBuilder(
        completionRequest: _completionRequest,
        openAIClient: _openAiClient,
        builder: (context, messages, onSend) {
          return MyMessageWidget();
        },
       );
```

You can also pass a `CreateCompletionRequest` to customize the request.

```dart
  final _completionRequest =
      CreateCompletionRequest(model: "text-davinci-003", maxTokens: 2048);

  return ChatGPTBuilder(
        completionRequest: _completionRequest,
        openAIClient: _openAiClient,
        builder: (context, messages, onSend) {
          return MyMessageWidget();
        },
      );
```
